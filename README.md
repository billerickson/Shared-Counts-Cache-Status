# Shared Counts - Prime Cache

The Shared Counts plugin builds its cache of share data over time as pages are viewed. If you have lots of content or are aggressively caching content, it could take a while before you have share data on the majority of your content.

This plugin adds a "Shared Counts Cache" settings page that shows you what percentage of content has share data attached. It also lets you "prime the cache" with a link for retrieving share data in bulk for the remaining pages (20 at a time).
